Ingredients:
  Meat (of prey animal)
  1 Large rock or club (See optional step below.)

Preparation:
  Tear a handful of the meat from the carcass of the prey and eat the meat.
  Repeat previous step until your stomach is engorged.

Extra Flavor (optional)
  Alternatively, rather than removing the meat from the carcass of the prey
  yourself, you could do the following steps:
    1. Hit another caveman on the head.
    2. Steal the meat from the other caveman, then eat the meat.
