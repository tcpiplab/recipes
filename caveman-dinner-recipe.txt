Ingredients:
  Meat (of prey animal*)

Tools:
  1 Hand Axe of sharp flint, obsidian, or other hard stone.
  1 Large rock or club, suitable as a weapon (See optional steps below.)

Preparation:
  Tear a handful of the meat from the carcass of the prey and eat the meat.
  Repeat previous step until your stomach is engorged.

Optional Steps:
  Alternatively, rather than remove the meat from the carcass of the prey
  yourself, you could perform the following steps:
    1. Use the rock or club to hit another caveman on the head. Repeat, if
    necessary, until he's subdued.
    2. Steal the meat from the other caveman, then eat the meat.

*The animal must not be human or human-like. I.e, Homo neanderthalensis is not
 an appropriate "prey animal" for this recipe.
