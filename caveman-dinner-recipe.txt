Ingredients:
  Meat (of prey animal)
  1 Large rock or club, suitable as a weapon (See optional steps below.)

Preparation:
  Tear a handful of the meat from the carcass of the prey and eat the meat.
  Repeat previous step until your stomach is engorged.

Optional Steps:
  Alternatively, rather than remove the meat from the carcass of the prey
  yourself, you could perform the following steps:
    1. Use the rock or club to hit another caveman on the head.
    2. Steal the meat from the other caveman, then eat the meat.
